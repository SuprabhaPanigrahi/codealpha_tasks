# Overview:
	This repository contains the source code for a Word Count program developed during my internship. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate Java programming skills, including file handling, string manipulation, and data processing.

# Features:
	 Word Counting: Counts the total number of words in a given text file.
	 Character Counting: Provides the total number of characters, including spaces.
	 Line Counting: Returns the number of lines present in the input file.
	 File Input Handling: Reads data from a specified file for analysis.
# Technologies Used:
     Java: Core programming language for implementing file I/O operations and data processing.
     IDE: Developed using IntelliJ IDEA
     Git: Version control system to track changes and collaborate on code.
# How to Run the Program:
## Prerequisites
    Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
        Java JDK (version 8 or later)
        Any Java-compatible IDE or a terminal to run Java programs
## Steps to Run
    1.Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/internship-java-project.git
        cd internship-java-project
    2.Compile the Java program:
       `javac` WordCount.java
    3.Run the program with a text file as input:
        java WordCount <input-file>
Replace <input-file> with the path to the text file you want to process.

## Example:
java WordCount sample.txt
## Sample Output
    Given an input file like:
         Hello Java Internship
         This is a test file.
The output will be:
        Number of words: 6
        Number of characters: 35
        Number of lines: 2
## Project Structure
    WordCount.java: Contains the core logic to read a file and count words, characters, and lines.
    input.txt: Sample text file (if provided) for testing the program.
## Learning Outcomes
    During this project, I gained experience with:
        Working with file I/O in Java
        Implementing logic to process strings and text data
        Using version control with Git for managing project versions
        Writing clean and efficient Java code
